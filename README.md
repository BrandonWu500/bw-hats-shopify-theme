## Description

**BW Hats** is my demo store. It uses a custom Shopify theme that I created. I tried to make it as realistic as possible to accurately simulate how I would create a Shopify website for a client.

## Technologies

Here is what I used to create BW Hats:

- Figma
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- Jira
- Shopify
- Liquid
- HTML
- Tailwind
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, in the terminal run:

1. `npm ci` to install dependencies with the right version
2. `npm run dev` to run the project

Then in a separate terminal window / tab run:

`npm run tw` to run the tailwind css compiler in watch mode
