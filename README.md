## Description

This is a custom Shopify theme that I created. Currently, it is not the live theme for my Shopify store (I am using an edited version of Dawn for that). However, this repository still serves as an example of how I would go about creating a custom Shopify theme for a client.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, in the terminal run:

1. `npm ci` to install dependencies with the right version
2. `npm run dev` to run the project

Then in a separate terminal window / tab run:

`npm run tw` to run the tailwind css compiler in watch mode
